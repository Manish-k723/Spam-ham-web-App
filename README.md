Deployment of streamlit app
Here, we are developing a classifier which helps to distinguish between spam and ham messages. 
The model was earlier deployed on heroku framework but now the link is not working. 
I am working on deploying the model on cyclic.sh. If anyone knows how to do it then i welcome you to contribute.
